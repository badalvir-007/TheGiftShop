         I have created a landing page and set up routes for various pages.
        While I haven't added any content yet, I wanted to demonstrate that the
        pages are functional. Once I gather the necessary content and data, I
        will proceed to incorporate it into the website. The main goal is to
        build a responsive website, and I'm in the initial stages of the
        development process.
